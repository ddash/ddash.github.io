A work in progress. 
In the beginning, done using the [FAQ](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) page. Specifically using the [Creating Pages with the automatic generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator/), and [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) questions.

# Todo
* Few pages using automatic generator
* Few pages using jekyll
* Few pages done from scratch
* Custom 404 page
